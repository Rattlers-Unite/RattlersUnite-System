# Welcome to Rattlers Unite!

Rattlers Unite is a event tracking site made for [St. Mary's University](https://stmarytx.edu) as part of the Spring 2023 Semester for Dr. Redfield's CS3340/CS6340 Software Engineering class.

## Purpose

The purpose of this site is to host events and organizations on campus in a more elegant fashion compared to the current university event system (via EMS Master Calendar) and provide an incentive into partaking in these events with points and a leaderboard!

## Features
1. Point System
   > Gather points by attending events by creating an account and providing your ID number. (Execution-wise, this is determined by your St. Mary's ID number on campus along with Gateway SSO to login to your account on Rattlers Unite)
2. Leaderboards
   > Climb the ranks in order to be in the top ten or be first amongst your peers by attending events and earning points!
3. Event Tracking
   > See all current and future events that will be happening either on-campus or off-campus!
4. Organization/Event information pages
   > Get detailed information about an organization and it's events that it host or about the event you want to attend itself!
5. Organization/Admin Portal
   > Manage your events and organization profile all in one place!
6. Login/Sign Up
   > (This would be replaced with a Gateway SSO and Gateway credentials execution-wise) Register for a Rattlers Unite account as either a student or organization and login to Rattlers Unite using your credentials.
